# GWebcache WIP
C# library and nuget package to interact with a Gnutella Webcache

## Documentation

You will find the documentation trough this [link](https://gnutellasharp.github.io/GWebcache/).
Documentation is being autogenerated based on XML comments in the code.
These are converted to html trough DoxyGen and deployed to github pages.
As a collaborator we ask that you provide [XML comments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags) when writing new classes or methods.
